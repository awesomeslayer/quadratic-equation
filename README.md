### Types of equations
This project easily solves equations with one, two, infinite or zero roots. 

### Usage
You have to download all files, open command line, type "make" and open executable file "QE". Next, you have to follow program advices!

### Tests
This project has unit tests, you can also add your tests in "tests.txt", using next form (use -1 for infinite roots, type roots in decreasing rate!):

a_coefficient, b_coefficient, c_coefficient, NumberOfRoots, FirstRoot, SecondRoot, TestNumber
